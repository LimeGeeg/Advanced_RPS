Advanced Rock Paper Scissors - a game in which you need to choose your character
and try your luck against the bot. In total, you are given 3 options to choose from: Wizard (1), Warrior (2), Rogue (3).
The rules are exactly the same as in the original game, the sorcerer defeats the warrior. The warrior defeats the robber. The robber defeats the sorcerer.
Each enemy has a certain number of lives, the level and life of the bot grow after each of your victories.
Your character also has its own level, points and lives. After each victory over the enemy, you will receive
+5 points, +1 level and + random number of lives depending on your level. For each damage dealt to an enemy
the number of important points increases by 1. The number of opponents is infinite, and with each round defeated, the difficulty increases.
